                            S2 PACKAGE
        Object oriented wrapper for functions on the sphere       
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
     The s2 package contains functionality to support functions
     defined on the sky/sphere and was developed primarily for 
     astrophysical applications. Both real space map and harmonic
     space spherical harmonic representations are supported. 
     Basic sky representations have been extended to simulate full sky
     noise distributions and Gaussian cosmic microwave background
     realisations.  Support for the representation and convolution of
     beams is also provided.  A HEALPix spherical pixelisation scheme
     is adopted, although this may be extended in the future to
     support other pixelisations of the sphere.

REFERENCE
     The s2 package was written originally for the development of fast
     continuous wavelet transform algorithms on the sphere but has
     since evolved to provide much additional functionality.
